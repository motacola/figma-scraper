**Last Updated**: December 22, 2024

## Overview

FigmaSnap is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our data practices for the FigmaSnap Chrome Extension.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What We Don't Collect:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Figma account credentials
- Prototype URLs
- Captured screenshots or PDFs
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports

## How the Extension Works

FigmaSnap operates entirely locally in your browser:

1. **Local Processing**: All screenshot capture and PDF generation happens directly in your browser
2. **No External Servers**: We do not send any data to external servers
3. **No Cloud Storage**: All files are saved directly to your local machine
4. **No Tracking**: We do not use cookies, analytics, or tracking technologies

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **`tabs`**: To identify and interact with Figma tabs
- **`activeTab`**: To capture screenshots of the current Figma prototype
- **`scripting`**: To inject content scripts for flow detection and navigation
- **`downloads`**: To save the generated PDF to your computer
- **`storage`**: To store your license key locally in your browser (never transmitted)

### Host Permissions:
- **`https://www.figma.com/*`**: Required to access Figma prototypes for capture

All permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and nothing else.

## Data Storage

The only data stored locally is:

This data:
- Never leaves your device

# FigmaSnap Product Guide v1.0.0

Thank you for purchasing **FigmaSnap**! Your $8.99 investment will save you hours of manual work.

## Getting Started

1. Launch FigmaSnap: Double-click the application icon.
2. Unlock: Enter your license key delivered via Gumroad.
   *Note: In development mode, keys starting with `FSNAP-` are accepted.*
3. Configure:
   * Figma URL: Paste the link to your Figma prototype.
   * Password: Enter the password if the prototype is protected.
   * Output Folder: Select where you want to save your screenshots and PDF.
4. Snap!: Click **Start Capture**. FigmaSnap will open Chrome, handle authentication, and walk through your prototype automatically.

## Tips for Success

* Ensure Chrome is installed: FigmaSnap uses your system's Google Chrome to ensure the best rendering of Figma's WebGL canvas.
* Manual Intervention: If Figma shows a login screen or a complex overlay, you can manually interact with the Chrome window that opens. The script will wait for you.
* Spacebar Support: If the prototype uses things other than Arrow keys, the script tries to press Spacebar to trigger transitions.

## Troubleshooting

* Chrome not found: Ensure Google Chrome is in your Applications folder (Mac) or Program Files (Windows).
* Canvas not detected: Some complex prototypes load slowly. FigmaSnap will wait up to 60 seconds before defaulting to manual mode.
* Permission Denied: On Mac/Windows, you may need to "Allow" the app to run as it is currently unsigned for the $8.99 price point.

## License Information

*   **One Key, One Computer**: Your license is locked to your hardware ID.
*   **Lifetime Access**: Pay once, use forever. No subscriptions.
